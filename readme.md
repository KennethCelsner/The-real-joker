#The Joker app (School project)

When you've cloned this repository, open the cmd in the map and write following:

npm install
npm install gulp -g
npm install gulp --save-dev
npm install browser-sync gulp --save-dev



When writing npm install, if you possibly get the WARN "npm WARN deprecated lodash@0.9.2: lodash@<2.0.0 is no longer
maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^3.0.0"
Write "npm install -g npm@2.14.10" and keep going.

When everything is installed you are ready to go, to start the app in your browser, write "gulp serve"
